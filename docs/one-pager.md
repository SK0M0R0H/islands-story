# Islands Story: One Pager

### Mantra
An onchain strategy game that allows players to _feel_ the intricacies of sharding technology.

### Design Pillars
* **Atomic unit under user control is a smart contract**: Each player’s settlement is represented by a smart contract, which acts as the core unit of gameplay.
* **Smart contracts on different shards have unique properties**: The world of Island Story is divided into shards, where each shard (or floating island) presents a different set of rules and features for settlements located there.
* **Gamification of cross-shard communication**: Players will experience real-world blockchain challenges, such as cross-shard communication, translated into strategic gameplay elements.
* **Wipe-based system**: Seasonal resets (wipes) introduce an element of unpredictability, ensuring dynamic game cycles and fresh strategic opportunities.

### Summary
In Island Story, the world is composed of Floating Islands, where each shard represents a separate island. These islands serve as autonomous, isolated environments with their own unique attributes. Players take control of settlements, which are distinct smart contracts that reside on these islands. Each settlement varies based on its shard, giving rise to different gameplay dynamics.

Settlements are centers of resource generation and development, allowing players to grow their influence and power. Resources produced in settlements can be used for expansion, trade, or even warfare. Players can engage in diplomacy and establish feudal relationships with neighboring settlements, ranging from alliances to vassal-lord dynamics.

The game's political structure is built around feudalism, where powerful settlements may influence or conquer others, but vassals retain significant autonomy and rights. Players can engage in trade, warfare, and cultural exchanges to influence their neighbors and the game world.

Each settlement can also randomly generate NFTs that represent unique in-game assets, adding an element of collectibility and personalization.

At the end of each season, a wipe occurs—a catastrophic event that resets the world, wiping out all settlements. Players will need to rebuild, providing ongoing strategic challenge and replayability.

### Main Features
* **Settlement Ownership & Shard-Specific Uniqueness**: Each player controls a settlement that is distinct depending on the shard (floating island) it’s located on. The shard’s rules and characteristics affect how the settlement can grow and interact with others.
* **Cross-Shard Communication**: Players will navigate the complexities of communication and interaction between settlements on different shards. This mechanic introduces unique challenges to trading, alliances, and combat.
* **Wipe-Based Gameplay**: Every season culminates in a catastrophic event that resets the game world. The “wipe” forces players to reconsider their strategies and offers opportunities to build anew.
* **Feudal Political System**: Players engage in a feudal hierarchy, where settlements can conquer or subdue others, but vassals still have significant autonomy. This system allows for complex political interactions, including alliances, vassal relationships, and diplomacy.
* **Settlement Development System**: Players can develop their settlements by generating resources, constructing buildings, and expanding their territory. Settlement growth increases influence and power, both locally and across shards.

### Target Audience
The initial target audience consists of early adopters of [=nil;](https://nil.foundation) and blockchain gamers who are comfortable interacting with blockchain-based interfaces. The game appeals to those who enjoy both the technical aspects of decentralized technology and strategic gameplay.
