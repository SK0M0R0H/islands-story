# Islands Story

Islands Story is an on-chain strategy game built on [=nil;](https://nil.foundation).

The game leverages and gamifies sharded blockchain functionality, allowing users to experience the dynamics of shard-based blockchain systems.

* Create and govern your own polis (city-state)
* Each polis is deployed as a unique smart contract
* The characteristics of each polis vary based on the shard where it's located
* Communication between polises depends on their location (same shard or across different shards)

Currently, the game is in its early stages of development. For now, the available features include (almost nothing):
* Creating your polis
* Sending resources to other polises

See [one pager](./docs/one-pager.md) for details on the planned gameplay.
